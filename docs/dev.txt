Timeout on sensors
==================

As all keys are not always returned by the teleinformation, a timeout has been defined only on the sensor for ADCO frame. This timeout has been set to 3 minutes. All other sensors timeouts are set to 0.

xPL
===

This plugin does not use xPL anymore since the release 1.2.
